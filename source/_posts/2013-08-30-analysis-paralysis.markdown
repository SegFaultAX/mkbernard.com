There are lots of things that can kill a project before it starts: lack of
funding, lack of time, lack of specification, lack of applicable talent, the
list goes on and on.  Many of these problems can be alleviated with creative
resource management and a bit of elbow grease. There is, however, a far more
subtle mental phenomenon that can be as destructive to the creator as it is to
the fledgling project:

> Analysis paralysis or paralysis of analysis is the state of over-analyzing (or
> over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in
> effect paralyzing the outcome. A decision can be treated as over-complicated,
> with too many detailed options, so that a choice is never made, rather than
> try something and change if a major problem arises. A person might be seeking
> the optimal or "perfect" solution upfront, and fear making any decision which
> could lead to erroneous results, when on the way to a better solution.

It's incredibly easy to start second guessing every decision you've made (or are
going to make) before you've made your first commit. In the early stages of any
project, one has to consider all the possible options available that could be
used to accomplish the task at hand and, from that list, choose just "the best"
one. To be sure, decisions made at this stage can greatly affect the outcome of
the project. But here's the rub: none of this will matter if you never actually
ship the project. It's *always* preferable to pick a path that turns out to be
wrong versus picking the path that leads to nothing at all.

So here's my advice to anyone setting out on a new project:

> Just pick something, anything, to get the ball rolling. Your requirements
> *will* change, there *will* be unplanned roadblocks, and **that's OK**. Worry
> about those things as they come up, not before. And most of all, **do not let
> your analysis paralysis get in the way of being useful!**
