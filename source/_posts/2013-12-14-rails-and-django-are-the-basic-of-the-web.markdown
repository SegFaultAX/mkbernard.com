[Edsger Dijkstra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger\_W.\_Dijkstra) was once
qutoed saying:

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have
> had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally
> mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

While I certainly believe that his point is debatable (at least in hindsight), I
think there is a modern corollary with respect to web programming:

> It is practically impossible to teach good web programming to students that
> have had a prior exposure to Rails, Django, Play, or Spring: as potential
> programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

Modern frameworks, and in particular [Object Relational Mappers], do an
absolutely wonderful job of abstracting away the monotonous boilerplate of
building yet another "RESTful CRUD SPA (tm)"

C. A. R. Hoare said it best:

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so
> simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make
> it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is
> far more difficult.
